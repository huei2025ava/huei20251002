      <p>
I was a ghost, I was alone, hah  
어두워진, hah, 압길속에 (Ah)  
Given the throne, I didn't know how to believe  
I was the queen that I'm meant to be  
I lived two lives, tried to play both sides  
But I couldn't find my own place  
Called a problem child 'cause I got too wild  
But now that's how I'm getting paid, 끝없이 on stage  

I'm done hidin', now I'm shinin' like I'm born to be  
We dreamin' hard, we came so far, now I believe  

We're goin' up, up, up, it's our moment  
You know together we're glowing  
Gonna be, gonna be golden  
Oh, up, up, up with our voices  
영원히 깨질 수 없는 Gonna be, gonna be golden  
Oh, I'm done hidin' now I'm shinin' like I'm born to be  
Oh, our time, no fear, no lies  
That's who we're born to be  

Waited so long to break these walls down  
To wake up and feel like me  
Put these patterns all in the past now  
And finally live like the girl they all see  

No more hiding, I'll be shining like I'm born to be  
'Cause we are hunters, voices strong, and I know I believe  

We're goin' up, up, up, it's our moment  
You know together we're glowing  
Gonna be, gonna be golden  
Oh, up, up, up, with our voices  
영원히 깨질 수 없는 Gonna be, gonna be golden  
Oh, I'm done hidin', now I'm shining like I'm born to be  
Oh, our time, no fears, no lies  
That's who we're born to be  

You know we're gonna be, gonna be golden  
We're gonna be, gonna be  
Born to be, born to be glowin'  
밝게 빛나는 우린  
You know that it's our time, no fears, no lies  
That's who we're born to be
